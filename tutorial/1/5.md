### 1.5 - Let's create a %feed station to subscribe to other ships' public stations

As hinted above, it'd be great if we had a %feed station to separate our porch subscriptions for chat from our own %public post station, and all the %public stations of other ships we might want to subscribe to.

So let's create it. Back at your `:talk` CLI prompt:

```
talk> ;create journal %feed 'all my feeds. :)'
```

As with your %public station, your %feed will be assigned an ASCII glyph. But for our public posts, let's not post to this station directly. Instead, we'll subscribe your personal %public station to your %feed and post in the former, to keep things cleanly separated and organized.

How are we going to subscribe to our station and other stations? Let's checkout to the `1.5` branch:

```
git checkout 1.5
```

Reload the page, and go ahead and click the button to subscribe your %public station to your %feed.

Now try sending another post from your console to your %public station, and even though your %feed is loaded on the web page, it should load automatically!

Let's walk through the new code once more (this will be the last code section before putting some finishing style touches on the demo!).


Your `tutorial.html` additions:

```

A new `tutorial.css` for some simple DOM button display/hide logic:

```
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

And the new `tutorial.js` additions:

```

```

We mentioned before that, on the backend, we've separated the different subsets of `:talk` station data by different single-letter keys. In the last two sections, we loaded all our `grams`, or message data from our %porch and %public stations, respectively, via the `f` key in our `urb.bind` path. We do the same here with our newly created %feed station, but to add subscribe/unsubscribe functionality, we also introduced a new option -- `cabal`, signified by the symbol letter `x` in our path.

To implement subscribe and unsubscribe functionality, we basically just need a way to view our main %feed station's current configuration and the current array of stations its subscribed to within that config. If we want to add a new station we found, we can just append the new station to our array, and send the new full station configuration back to our ship with an `urb.send` request.

Our `cabal` data is exactly this. Your %feed's cabal contains all of the station's configuration, within which is the list of stations your %feed is sourcing from. Like our `grams`, we request this data as JSON via the `"json"` mark in our `:talk` path of the `urb.bind` request.

Whereas last time with our `grams` we needed to specify a date to load our station's messages since, with `cabal` we only need to specify the station to get the configuration data. Thus, our full `:talk` path for this `urb.bind` request is: `http://localhost:8443/~/is/~[ship]/talk/x/feed.json?PUT`, where [ship] again is your full comet name.

So, the full JSON `bind` payload is:

```
{
  "oryx": "rabneb-dibtyv-fasset-haswyd--fondeg-noldel-datrup-magdyr",
  "ship": "londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb",
  "appl": "talk",
  "mark": "json",
  "path": "/x/feed",
  "wire": "/x/feed"
}
```

Like our `grams`, if this station's subscriptions on the backend are modified during our browser session, our ship will automatically push the new `cabal` to our web UI through %eyre.

For the sake of this being a quick tutorial, when we receive the cabal from the bind call, we set this as a window global to make it accessible. For a real production web UI, of course, you might want to use something like React's state model like we use in our production `:talk` web UI for these kinds of things.

Nonetheless, once our `cabal` bind request is successful, we specify in our callback to look in the sources data structure and either show the *Subscribe* button if the station you're currently viewing is not included in your %feed's subscribed sources, or the *Unsubscribe* button if your loaded %feed is already subscribed to it.

Just to test this out, visit your own ship's %public station via the `Fetch` box at the top of the page and, assuming you `;joined` your %public station in the last section, go ahead and click the `Unsubscribe` button again to remove your %public station from your %feed's sources.

Sure enough, if you go back to your %feed at the regular `localhost:8443/urbit-web/tutorial.html` link and subsequently post another %public message from your ship's CLI (make this one good too):

> another funny thing

the post won't show up in your web page's %feed.

But going back to your %public page and manually Subscribing through your interface and checking your web %feed again:

will show it!

Okay, so our frontend knows which stations we're subscribed and not subscribed to. But what do we actually send our ship to customize our feed?

As hinted above, upon clicking this button to either subscribe or unsubscribe from the station we're viewing, we either append or remove the station, respectively, from our current loaded %feed station sources, which we stored in a window global for ease and which we received in our station's `cabal` from our `urb.bind` call. Then, once we have our new sources, we can simply send a `design` payload via our `urb.send` function which, like the typed `:talk` post we formatted in the `1.2` section, sends our modified `%feed` station configuration (since we don't need to calculate a new date and serial number on the frontend like we had to do to send a valid typed `:talk` message in the earlier examples, we don't need any helper functions for this `urb.send` design payload; in our JavaScript we just send our modified global cabal variable with the new subscription appended to our cabal's list of sources):

```
{
  "oryx": "sigset-fidnyl-mosdes-simdef--litrud-middus-fipnus-matwyn",
  "ship": "londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb",
  "appl": "talk",
  "mark": "talk-command",
  "wire": "/",
  "xyro": {
    "design": {
      "party": "feed",
      "config": {
        "sources": [
          "~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb/public"
        ],
        "caption": "list of feeds.",
        "cordon": {
          "posture": "green",
          "list": []
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Remember CQS. Asking for your station configuration via `urb.bind` won't change anything; the only way to change your %feed station's configuration is to explicitly tell %eyre to do so via an `urb.send` call. And like our `grams` example, since you're still bound to the station's endpoint for its `cabal` data, once your ship receives the %gall change on the backend, it will push that back through %eyre to your web session automatically in this clean unidirectional data flow.

But this is basically a complete, albeit super basic, microblogging UI. You can post to your own %public station through the UI, subscribe and unsubscribe to other ships' public stations, and view them all in one timeline-like feed! All in only about 300 lines of frontend code, using the existing robust `:talk` backend API.

Let's move onto our last section to put some finishing touches on our demo.
