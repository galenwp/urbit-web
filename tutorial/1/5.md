### 1.5 - Let's create a %feed station to subscribe to other ships' public stations

As hinted above, it'd be great if we had a %feed station to separate our porch subscriptions for chat from our own %public post station, and all the %public stations of other ships we might want to subscribe to.

So let's create it. Back at your `:talk` CLI prompt:

```
talk> ;create journal %feed 'all my feeds. :)'
```

As with your %public station, your %feed will be assigned an ASCII glyph. But for our public posts, let's not post to this station directly. Instead, we'll subscribe your personal %public station to your %feed and post in the former, to keep things cleanly separated and organized.

How are we going to subscribe to our station and other stations? Let's checkout to the `1.5` branch:

```
git checkout 1.5
```

Reload the page, and go ahead and click the button to subscribe your %public station to your %feed.

Now try sending another post from your console to your %public station, and even though your %feed is loaded on the web page, it should load automatically!

Let's walk through the code once more (this will be the last code section before putting some finishing touches on the demo!).

We mentioned before that, on the backend, we've separated the different subsets of `:talk` station data by different single-letter keys. In the last two sections, we loaded all our `grams`, or message data from our %porch and %public stations, respectively, via the `f` key in our `urb.bind` path. We do the same here with our newly created %feed station, but to add subscribe/unsubscribe functionality, we introduced a new option -- `cabal`, signified by the symbol letter `x` in our path.

To implement subscribe and unsubscribe functionality, we basically just need a way to view the current array of stations our main %feed station is subscribed to. If we want to add a new station we found, we can just append the new station to our array, and send the new full station configuration back to our ship with an `urb.send` request.

Our `cabal` data is exactly this, the stations our %feed station is sourcing from. Like our `grams`, we request this data as JSON via the `"json"` mark in our `:talk` path of the `urb.bind` request.

Whereas last time with our `grams` we needed to specify a date to load our station's messages since, with `cabal` we only need to specify the station to get the configuration data. Thus, our full `:talk` path for this `urb.bind` request is: `http://localhost:8443/~/is/~[ship]/talk/x/feed.json?PUT`, where [ship] again is your full comet name.

Like our `grams`, if this station's subscriptions on the backend are modified during our browser session, our ship will automatically push those %gall app changes to our web UI through %eyre.

When we receive the cabal from the bind call, we set this as a global to window.sources to make it accessible (this is fine for the tutorial, but for more complex apps you might want to use something like React's state model like we use in `:talk` for these kinds of things). Then it becomes easy to look in that data structure and either show the *Subscribe* button if the station you're currently viewing is included in the sources, or the *Subscribed* (click to unsubscribe) button if the current station is included in your loaded %feed.

Just to test this out, go ahead and click the button again which will unsubscribe you from your %public station.

Sure enough, if you post another %public message (make this one good too):

> another funny thing

it won't show up in your page's %feed.

But subscribing again:

will show it!

Okay, so our frontend knows which stations we're subscribed and not subscribed to. But what do we actually send our ship to customize our feed?

Here's the code:

```
* XX
```

```
* XX
```

As hinted above, upon clicking this button to either subscribe or unsubscribe from the station we're viewing, we either append or remove the station, respectively, from our current loaded %feed station sources which we received in our station's `cabal` from our `urb.bind` call. Then, once we have our new sources, we can simply send a `design` payload via our `urb.send` function which, like the typed `:talk` post we formatted in the `1.2` section, represents a typed `:talk` station configuration.

Remember CQS. Asking for your station configuration via `urb.bind` won't change anything; the only way to change your %feed station's configuration is to explicitly tell %eyre to do so via an `urb.send` call. And like our `grams` example, since you're still bound to the station's endpoint for its `cabal` data, once your ship receives the %gall change on the backend, it will push that back through %eyre to your web session automatically in this clean unidirectional data flow.
