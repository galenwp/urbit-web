### 1.0 - Setup and serve files to the web

For this section, we'll assume you've followed the [setup](https://urbit.org/docs/using/setup) instructions, and your ship has its `%clay` filesystem mounted to Unix.  Assuming you have a directory like `comet` for your ship, you should also have a `comet/home` directory.

First, for loading the initial files, stop your Urbit (with `^D` at the `dojo>` prompt).  This should drop you back into Unix.  To confirm your files are mounted properly:

```
$ ls comet/home
app  arvo  gen  lib  mar  ren  sec  sur  web  web.md
```

Your home desk's `web` directory is the similar to `public_html` directory. Your ship looks in this directory to serve content to the web.

Let's clone our repo in your `web/` directory:

```
$ cd comet/home/web
$ git clone https://github.com/keatondunsford/urbit-web.git
$ cd urbit-web
```

As we progress, you can `git checkout` to the appropriate branch for the section and reload the new version of the web page being served.

Our first example is in the `1.0` branch. Let's check it out:

```
$ git checkout 1.0
```

Now, in a new terminal window, fire up your ship again:

```
$ cd ../../
$ urbit comet
```

If your ship is now running, you should see something like this:

```
~
urbit 0.4.4
urbit: home is comet
...
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321
ames: czar zod.urbit.org: ip .104.197.214.171
~londyn_davteb:dojo>
```

where `~londyn_davteb` is your comet name, abbreviated.

You should also see that your ship registered three newly added files:

```
~londyn_davteb:dojo> \«sync»
+ /~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb/home/2/web/urbit-web/package/json
+ /~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb/home/2/web/urbit-web/tutorial/html
+ /~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb/home/2/web/urbit-web/tutorial/tutorial/js
>
```

> For this tutorial series, we'll abbreviate the full `~londyn_davteb:dojo>` prompt to just `>`:

You got two files, some `html` and some `js`.  They're pretty simple:

```
###
# tutorial.html
###

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Urbit from the Web</title>

    <script src="/=home=/web/urbit-web/tutorial/tutorial.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>

    <div>
      <h1>Hello, Mars!</h1>
      <button onclick="someJavaScript();">A button test!</button>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>
```

```
###
# tutorial.js
###

console.log("We're serving some JavaScript through Urbit to the browser.");

function someJavaScript() {                             // test
  console.log("Now we're calling some other JavaScript.");
}

window.module = window.module || {};
module.exports = {
  someJavaScript: someJavaScript
};
```

And, they're already being served to the web: http://localhost:8443/urbit-web/tutorial.html

> Note that if you had a first Urbit ship running when you started up your current comet, your web directory will be served to `https://localhost:8444`; two other ships running, `https://localhost:8445`, etc.

You should see something like this:

* XX
!['Hello, Mars!' We're serving some trivial HTML and JavaScript to the browser. through Urbit](https://placeimg.com/640/480/arch/grayscale)

A quick look at the developer tools should show a the result of our `console.log`.

Every running ship's files also automatically map to urbit.org's DNS at `ship.urbit.org`. You can see your full comet ship name with the `our` dojo command.

For example:

```
> our
~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb
```

Then, you can view this same page at something like:

```
https://londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb.urbit.org/urbit-web/tutorial.html
```

Things should be working just the same, though your page will load a bit slower. (Pages on `*.urbit.org` are proxied over Urbit's own networking, `%ames`.) For development, we mostly use `localhost`. We'll keep using `localhost` for this tutorial.

Onward!  Let's send something from the web to your ship.
