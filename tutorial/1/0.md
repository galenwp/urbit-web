### 1.0 - Let's start up our ship and serve a file to the web!

Fire up your ship as per our [basic operation](https://urbit.org/docs/using/admin/) document.

```
$ urbit mycomet
```

If your ship is now running, you should see that you've entered the `:dojo`. Something like this:

```
~
urbit 0.4.4
urbit: home is mycomet
...
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321
ames: czar zod.urbit.org: ip .104.197.214.171
~lannyx_lishes:dojo>
```

where `~lannyx_lishes` is your comet name, abbreviated.

For those still semi-new to Urbit, the `:dojo` is just Urbit's version of a command line.

> For this tutorial series, we'll abbreviate the full `~lannyx_lishes:dojo>` prompt to just `>`:
> ```
> > |hi ~zod
> ```

We'll assume your ship's `%clay` filesystem is mounted to your local machine as per the setup doc linked in this tutorial's [overview](/~~/tutorial/1).

An Urbit ship boots with a default Arvo `home` `desk`, or version-controlled directory:

```
$ ls mycomet/home
app  arvo  gen  lib  mar  ren  sec  sur  web  web.md
```

Your home desk's `web` directory is the equivalent of a public_html directory. Your ship looks in this directory to serve content to the world. You can read up on Urbit's web details [here](https://urbit.org/docs/using/web/).

For this tutorial, we've included all the necessary frontend code for you to run in a Git repo which you can clone into your ship.

Go ahead and `cd` into your ship's home desk's web directory and `git clone` the following repo:

```
$ cd mycomet/home/web
$ git clone https://github.com/keatondunsford/tutorial.git
```
* XX github/urbit
* XX remove README, LICENSE, and eslint stuff for `cp`ing purposes -- or maybe those will go away if I check out to a new branch.

As we progress, you can simply `git checkout` to the appropriate branch for the section, and everything should just work.

Our first example is in the `1.0` branch. Go ahead and checkout to it:

```
$ git checkout 1.0
```

If this worked, you should see in your `:dojo` that your ship registered two newly added files:

```
+ /~lannyx-parlyn-picrus-latruc--tacnel-wactec-livput-lishes/home/2/web/tutorial/html
+ /~lannyx-parlyn-picrus-latruc--tacnel-wactec-livput-lishes/home/2/web/tutorial/tutorial/js
>

```

The `%clay` version-control number (the number between `home` and `web`), or `case`, of your home desk should be incremented as a result of the change (from `1` to `2` on a brand new comet). We'll explain this in a second.

This is just an HTML Hello World sourcing some trivial vanilla JavaScript.

`tutorial.html`:

```
* XX
```

`tutorial.js`:

```
* XX
```

These files are now already being served to the web.

Your ship's web files get served to `localhost` port `8443`. Let's load up the `tutorial.html`:

```
http://localhost:8443/tutorial.html
```

Sure enough:

* XX
!['Hello, Mars!' We're serving some trivial HTML and JavaScript to the browser. through Urbit](https://placeimg.com/640/480/arch/grayscale)

A quick look at your Chrome Dev Tools should validate that our code was sourced and is working.

> Note that if you had a first Urbit ship running when you started up your current comet, your web directory will be served to `https://localhost:8444`; two other ships running, `https://localhost:8445`, etc.

Every running ship's files also automatically map to urbit.org's DNS at `ship.urbit.org`. You can see your full comet ship name with the `our` dojo command.

```
> our
~lannyx-parlyn-picrus-latruc--tacnel-wactec-livput-lishes

```

Then, you can view this same page at something like `https://lannyx-parlyn-picrus-latruc--tacnel-wactec-livput-lishes.urbit.org/tutorial.html` in your browser. Things should be working just the same, though your page will load a bit slower. So for development, we mostly use `localhost`. We'll keep using `localhost` for this tutorial.
