### 1.0 - Let's clone our tutorial code repo, start up your ship and serve the first files to the web.

For this section, we'll assume your ship's `%clay` filesystem is mounted to your local machine as per the [setup ](https://urbit.org/docs/using/setup) document linked in this tutorial's [overview](/urbit-web/tutorial/1). For this first part, your ship will need to be turned *off* as an inconvenient bug we've yet to fix won't let you clone our code repo while your ship is running.

An Urbit ship boots with a default Arvo `home` `desk`, or version-controlled directory:

```
$ ls mycomet/home
app  arvo  gen  lib  mar  ren  sec  sur  web  web.md
```

Your home desk's `web` directory is the equivalent of a public_html directory. Your ship looks in this directory to serve content to the world.

We've structured the tutorial code for this Part 1 in a Git repo that models a standard Urbit web development workflow.

With your ship not running, go ahead and `cd` into your ship's home desk's web directory, `git clone` the following repo, then `cd` into the repo:

```
$ cd mycomet/home/web
$ git clone https://github.com/keatondunsford/urbit-web.git
$ cd urbit-web
```

As we progress, you can simply `git checkout` to the appropriate branch for the section and reload the new version of the web page being served. Everything should just work.

Our first example is in the `1.0` branch. In the same window, go ahead and checkout to it:

```
$ git checkout 1.0
```

Now, in a new terminal window, fire up your ship as per our [basic operation](https://urbit.org/docs/using/admin/) document.

```
$ urbit mycomet
```

If your ship is now running, you should see that you've entered the `:dojo`. Something like this:

```
~
urbit 0.4.4
urbit: home is mycomet
...
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321
ames: czar zod.urbit.org: ip .104.197.214.171
~londyn_davteb:dojo>
```

where `~londyn_davteb` is your comet name, abbreviated.

For those still semi-new to Urbit, the `:dojo` is just Urbit's version of a command line.

If the Git checkout worked, you should see in your `:dojo` window that your ship registered three newly added files:

```
~londyn_davteb:dojo> \«sync»
+ /~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb/home/2/web/urbit-web/package/json
+ /~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb/home/2/web/urbit-web/tutorial/html
+ /~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb/home/2/web/urbit-web/tutorial/tutorial/js
>
```

> For this tutorial series, we'll abbreviate the full `~londyn_davteb:dojo>` prompt to just `>`:
> ```
> > |hi our
> ```

> The `package.json` is just for ESLint in case you want to extend this later. Don't `npm install` within a running ship or it will crash.

This is just an HTML Hello World sourcing some trivial vanilla JavaScript.

`tutorial.html`:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>Urbit from the Web</title>

    <script src="/=home=/web/urbit-web/tutorial/tutorial.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>

    <div>
      <h1>Hello, Mars!</h1>
      <button onclick="someJavaScript();">A button test!</button>
    </div>

  </body>
</html>
```

`tutorial.js`:

```
console.log("We're serving some JavaScript through Urbit to the browser.");

function someJavaScript() {                             // test
  console.log("Now we're calling some other JavaScript.");
}

window.module = window.module || {};
module.exports = {
  someJavaScript: someJavaScript
};
```

These files are now already being served to the web.

Your ship's web files get served to `localhost` port `8443`, and your HTML file is within the newly cloned `urbit-web` directory within `web`. Let's load up the `tutorial.html` in Chrome:

```
http://localhost:8443/urbit-web/tutorial.html
```

Sure enough:

* XX
!['Hello, Mars!' We're serving some trivial HTML and JavaScript to the browser. through Urbit](https://placeimg.com/640/480/arch/grayscale)

A quick look at your Chrome Dev Tools should validate that your code was sourced and is working.

> Note that if you had a first Urbit ship running when you started up your current comet, your web directory will be served to `https://localhost:8444`; two other ships running, `https://localhost:8445`, etc.

Every running ship's files also automatically map to urbit.org's DNS at `ship.urbit.org`. You can see your full comet ship name with the `our` dojo command.

```
> our
~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb
```

Then, you can view this same page at something like `https://londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb.urbit.org/urbit-web/tutorial.html` in your browser. Things should be working just the same, though your page will load a bit slower. So for development, we mostly use `localhost`. We'll keep using `localhost` for this tutorial.

You can find a lot more of Urbit `web` details [here](https://urbit.org/docs/using/web/).

Let's move on to the next section where you'll send something from the web to your ship for the first time.
