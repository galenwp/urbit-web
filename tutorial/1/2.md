### 1.2 - Let's send yourself a message using `:talk`

You've probably already used Urbit's `:talk` command-line and web UI's for our distributed chat. But really, the `:talk` API is a general-purpose piece of infrastructure for messaging and notifications that `:talk`-the-UI just happens to use. Meaning, you can actually use the `:talk` protocol as a basic message bus and data store.

Before you checkout to the next branch, you'll need to officially Log In to your ship through the web to gain full authentication privileges. That way you can send `:talk` messages from your own code smoothly. And while you're at it, you can take a peek at `:talk` the existing web app to better understand the `:talk` API it's built on top of.

Head to your `:talk` web UI being served at `https://localhost:8443/~~/talk`. The `/~~/` in the URL will redirect you to a Log In page asking for a password, which you can retrieve from the `+code` `:dojo` command and paste into the Log In box. Something like:

```
> +code
finduc-moclep-satrus-witsub
```

If you successfully logged in, your `:talk` web app should load up
automatically:

> * XX ![screenshot of talk the web ui](https://placeimg.com/640/480/arch/grayscale)

The `:talk` protocol is organized around _posts_ and _stations_. Posts are typed, authenticated, encrypted messages, and stations are configurable feeds to send and read posts.

> This is all you really need to know for this tutorial, but more details on the protocol can be found [here](https://urbit.org/docs/using/messaging).

Let's try playing around with this here in the current `:talk` web UI, and then let's see if you can replicate similar functionality in your own UI with the frontend tools already in your ship.

Since you're on a comet, you can send yourself a direct `:talk` post at your *~ship/porch* station by inputting your _audience_, post text and sending by hitting the Enter key:

* XX ![GIF close-up of typing, sending and receiving message in web UI and `:dojo`.](https://placeimg.com/640/480/arch/grayscale)

You may find the Console and Networking activity interesting, but we'll have implemented the same functionality ourselves in a minute.

There are different kinds of `:talk` stations. Your porch is a `%mailbox`; like an inbox, it's publicly writeable, but only you can decrypt its posts and read from it.

Let's see if you can code your own simple way to send yourself a private porch message by modifying your code from the last section.

`checkout` to the `1.2` branch:

```
$ git checkout 1.2
```

Load up your `http://localhost:8443/urbit-web/tutorial.html` page again, and go ahead and try sending yourself a `:talk` message!

Cool, this worked. With your dev tools again, let's look at the JSON payload you sent this time:

```
{
  "oryx": "falwep-docder-marmev-norpur--sabsem-botlex-hodnup-dirsup",
  "ship": "londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb",
  "wire": "/",
  "appl": "talk",
  "mark": "talk-command",
  "xyro": {
    "publish": [
      {
        "serial": "0v7.985re.6urnn.8g80s.7mn5o.2njuo.0e4mk",
        "audience": {
          "~londyn-foshut-hanrun-mipful--sapsyp-timdet-holwel-davteb/porch": {
            "envelope": {
              "visible": true,
              "sender": null
            },
            "delivery": "pending"
          }
        },
        "statement": {
          "bouquet": [],
          "speech": {
            "lin": {
              "txt": "test from my own code!",
              "say": true
            }
          },
          "date": 1489430871493              * XX update to publish day date
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This may look a bit more intimidating, but actually your payload is pretty much the same as your last 'hi':
- You have a new CSRF `oryx` for the session.
- Your `ship` and `wire` are the same.
- Your `appl` is now `"talk"`.
- Your `mark` is now a `"talk-command"`.
- And then you have this way-different `xyro` data value: a typed
  `:talk` post.

So, let's look under the hood of your code.

New additions to your `tutorial.html`:

```
...

  <head>

    ...

    <script src="/~~/~/at/=home=/web/lib/js/urb.js"></script>
    <script src="/~~/=home=/web/urbit-web/tutorial/tutorial.js"></script>

  </head>

  <body>
    <div>
      <h1 id="shipDisplay"></h1>
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      <input id="postBox" type="text" size="80" value="">Text
      <br />
      <button id="postButton" onclick='sendPost();'>Post</button>
    </div>

    <script>
      document.getElementById('shipDisplay').innerHTML = '~' + window.urb.user;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

New additions to your `main.js`:

```
// util

function mainStation(user) {
  switch (user.length) {
    case 3:
      return 'court';
    case 6:
      return 'floor';
    default:
      return 'porch';
  }
}

function uuid32() {                                     // generate unique serial number
  var i;
  var digitGroup;
  var serial = '0v' + Math.ceil(Math.random() * 8) + '.';
  for (i = 0; i <= 5; ++i) {
    digitGroup = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10000000).toString(32);
    digitGroup = ('00000' + digitGroup).substr(-5, 5);
    serial += digitGroup + '.';
  }
  return serial.slice(0, -1);
}

// main

function sendPost() {
  var audience;
  var post;
  var speech;
  var station;
  var text;
  var thought;

  document.getElementById('postButton').disabled = true;

  text = document.getElementById('postBox').value;
  station = '~' + window.urb.user + '/' + mainStation(window.urb.user);

  audience = {};
  audience[station] = {
    envelope: {
      visible: true,
      sender: null
    },
    delivery: 'pending'
  };

  speech = {
    lin: {
      txt: text,
      say: true
    }
  };

  thought = {
    serial: uuid32(),
    audience: audience,
    statement: {
      bouquet: [],
      speech: speech,
      date: Date.now()
    }
  };

  post = {};
  post.publish = [thought];

  return window.urb.send(
    post,                                               // data
    {                                                   // params
      appl: 'talk',
      mark: 'talk-command',
      ship: window.urb.user
    },
    function sentMessage(error, response) {             // callback
      if (error || !response.data || response.fail) {
        console.warn('`urb.send` to ~' + window.urb.user + ' the data payload:');
        console.warn(post);
        console.warn('failed. Error:');
        console.warn(error);
        console.warn(response);
        return;
      }
      console.log('`urb.send` to ~' + window.urb.user + ' the data payload:');
      console.log(post);
      console.log('succeeded! Response:');
      console.log(response.data);
      document.getElementById('postButton').disabled = false;
    });
}

window.module = window.module || {};
module.exports = {
  sendPost: sendPost
};
```

This code actually isn't super interesting. Your `urb.send` call is basically the same as your last 'Hi' example, as you could probably infer from the JSON payload sent above. The only different things really are the helper functions that collectively you use to format a valid `:talk` post.

A `:talk` post is pretty simple. It needs:
- a sender -- your ship in this case;
- an audience-- your porch here;
- a serial number -- a 32-character [`UUID`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier);
- a date -- whenever `Date.now()` was at the time the message was sent;
- and the post text itself.

Once you construct your valid `:talk` message from your post box input, you send this object as the `xyro` or `data` value of your `urb.send` call, along with the `"talk"` `appl` and `"talk-command"` mark. `%eyre` then reads this POST request, parses its contents, and passes the `:talk` post data to your ship's `:talk` backend.

Or, put visually:

```
DOM input -> urb.send -> JSON.stringify -> XHR -> %eyre HTTP server -> :talk backend
```

> All of the different urb.js requests are [here](http://urbit.org/docs/using/web/#-urb-js) in our Urbit docs.

Let's delve into a few more requests in the next sections as they relate to using the `:talk` protocol for your own apps.
