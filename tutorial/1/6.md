### 1.6 - Let's finish this thing!

Our new %feed UI is great, but it's pretty ugly. Let's style it a bit!

For the last time in this Part 1, checkout to the next branch, `1.6`:

```
git checkout 1.6
```

* XX Didn't use any React/Redux, but that's pretty trivial and is something we can go into in the Part 2 of this series -- whatever that will be!

But hopefully this tutorial helped you understand some of the basic frontend functionality of Urbit, and how Urbit web apps can work generally using `:talk` for some basic backend infrastructure.

Thanks!
