# Urbit from the Web

## Part 1

### Overview

Here in Part 1, we're going to cover the basics of how to communicate with an Urbit ship's backend from a trivial vanilla frontend. We'll use our `urb.js` HTTP API and our `:talk` protocol as a simple message bus to build a miniature microblogging clone. You'll be able to send direct messages to your ship, create new personal "stations" where you can aggregate messages, load a station's messages onto the page, and end up with a personal web UI where you can organize and subscribe to public feeds.

If you haven't already, follow the instructions in our documentation to [install Urbit](https://urbit.org/docs/using/install) and [setup your first Urbit ship](https://urbit.org/docs/using/setup). You'll be able to boot a free _comet_, or disposable Urbit identity, to serve as the ship for this tutorial. If you already have a ship, we still recommend booting a new throwaway comet for this tutorial as this Part 1 only became possible after a number of Arvo maintenance-branch fixes.

Lastly, we'll assume you're using Google Chrome and its Developer Tools for this tutorial. But of course if you prefer to use something else you can use that too.

Let's get started!
