# Urbit from the Web

## Part 1

### Overview

Here in Part 1, we're going to cover the basics of how to communicate with Urbit from a browser. We'll use our `urb.js` JavaScript library in a browser and the `talk` protocol on the Urbit side to build a miniature microblogging system. You'll be able to post updates to your Urbit and subscribe to other feeds on the network.

If you haven't already, follow the instructions in our documentation to [install Urbit](https://urbit.org/docs/using/install) and [setup your first Urbit ship](https://urbit.org/docs/using/setup). You'll be able to boot a free _comet_, or disposable Urbit identity, to serve as the ship for this tutorial.

If you already have a ship, it could be a good idea to fire up a comet for this tutorial.  This code depends on pathces that have recently gone out to the network.

Also, we assume you're using Chrome and its Developer Tools for this tutorial. But of course if you prefer to use something else it'll probably work.  Let us know if you have trouble.

Let's get started!
